        <h2> The Journey So Far in Upskill'24</h2>
        <p>
            So far in the training, we've been able to cover some basic concepts for beginners in web development including:
        - Development Tools: we have been introduced to tools that help developers do their job like code editors eg. VS Code
        - Version Control: We have covered different version control options but focused on git and git hub.
        - Basic HTML: What a HTML document looks like and basic syntax.
